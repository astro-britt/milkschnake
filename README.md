# milkschnake
This is going to be a reinforcement learning snake! 

TODO: 
- set up the environment using the battlesnake website thing
- decide on the rewards policy - this will be the fun part
- make the actual agent/model so that it can make decisions
- get it to play live games and collect data so it can train
- let it train for a while
- play with the rewards policy and see what changes

This subdirectory will handle everything relating to the agent's environment; a lot of it will be borrowed from the python starter snake. 

It needs to handle:
* loading the initial game state, and all subsequent ones
* passing the game state on to the agent and recieving the agent's decision
* passing the agent's decision to the battlesnake server
* letting the agent know when the game has finished
* saving data relevant to training the agent
